Assignment1:Review Comment

### 1. The Null and Alternative hypothesis are formulated correctly in both words and formular. It would be better to put â€˜avgtime'in the subscript like this
H<sub>0</sub> : W<sub>avgtime</sub> <= M<sub>avgtime</sub>
### and denote that 'W' stands for women, 'M' stands for men. and 'avgtime' stands for average time of riding during the weekdays

### 2. The data supports the project: it has the appropriate variables to answer the question, and was properly pre-processed to extract the needed columns.
### A possible processing of the data would be extract men and women data from the gender columns, which will prepare for the further statistical testing.



### 3. As for the test for this quesiton, since it has two samples data(men's tripduraton data and women's tripudration data). we don't know the population variance. Therefore, t-test can be applied here because it could use the sample variance to caculate.


### 4.The figure gives us a very interesting observation. A validation using other months or years data to test the same question can be considered. Is there a seasonal pattern? or is this parttern only hold for some months or the hold year.
