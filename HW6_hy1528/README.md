## Assignment1:Review Comment
### I make my comment for yunhecui(yc3420) HW4 Citibike assignment
#### 1. The Null and Alternative hypothesis are formulated correctly in both words and formular. It would be better to put â€˜avgtime'in the subscript like this
H<sub>0</sub> : W<sub>avgtime</sub> <= M<sub>avgtime</sub>
#### and denote that 'W' stands for women, 'M' stands for men. and 'avgtime' stands for average time of riding during the weekdays

#### 2. The data supports the project: it has the appropriate variables to answer the question, and was properly pre-processed to extract the needed columns.
#### A possible processing of the data would be extract men and women data from the gender columns, which will prepare for the further statistical testing.



#### 3. As for the test for this quesiton, since the question is do difference exist between mean women tripduration and mean men tripduration and it has two samples data(men's tripduraton data and women's tripudration data) and we don't know the population variance. Therefore, t-test can be applied here because it could use the sample variance to caculate.


#### 4.The figure gives us a very interesting observation. A validation using other months or years data to test the same question can be considered. Is there a seasonal pattern? or is this parttern only hold for some months or the hold year.

## Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests as well as for the Readme.md

I cooperate with Jianwei Li and Wenjie Zheng in this part. Please see our work below.

## Assignment 3 

I worked alone for this part. I follwed the instruction that the skelton gives me .

## Assignment 4 
I worked alone for this part.
I choose April, August and December as my three data set for the tripduration question and extra credit question.
I perform all the test on entire dataset and sample dataset.
For extra credit problem, I use Google maps API to help me determine which borough does the start station belongs to.
