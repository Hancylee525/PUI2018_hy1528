## Assignment 1 Review

These graphs are very well made!

I just have one question: for Figure 1, I'm assuming that each dot represents a different school district.  However, for the other figures (Figure 2-5), the school districts are not as clear.

Is it that the dots in Figure 1 are the school districts, or do regions highlighted in the other figures represent the school districts?

Other than that, the plots are easy to read, and the heat map-like set up is very intuitive.  Great job!
